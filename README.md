# Dataflow graphs as complete causal graphs

This repository accompanies the paper "Dataflow graphs as complete causal graphs", to be presented at CAIN 2023.

The notebook contains two experiments, both of which run on Insurance Claims application. The application code itself is a trimmed down version of what is implemented [here](https://github.com/mlatcl/fbp-vs-soa).

To reproduce the experiments install the requirements and then run the notebook.
