# Dataflow graphs as complete causal graphs

This repository accompanies the paper "Dataflow graphs as complete causal graphs", to be presented at CAIN 2023. The paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09552).

The notebook contains two experiments, both of which run on Insurance Claims application. The application code itself is a trimmed down version of what is implemented [here](https://github.com/mlatcl/fbp-vs-soa).

To reproduce the experiments install the requirements and then run the notebook.
